title: 'Contact | Open Systems Association'

The Open Systems Association works mainly through collaboration, both between its members and with other groups with whom we can conduct investigations.  Its members have worked in tandem with school teachers, mothers, sex work activists, OCD support groups, monks, local community groups, and more.  We’re open to anything from friendly chat to full co-experimentation approached from an open and curious standpoint.

If you would like to find out more about the approach of the Open Systems Association or have something you’d like to discuss, please email us at [info@opensystem.org.uk](mailto:info@opensystem.org.uk) and we’ll be happy to have a chat.
