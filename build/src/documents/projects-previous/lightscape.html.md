Lightscape Navigator is a wearable device that transmutes light into vibration. cross-wiring triggers a process of defamiliarisation which is extremely useful when trying to develop alternative modes feeling, allowing the user to rethink her relationship with sunlight anew. This project explores new possibilities for human / non-human interaction.
