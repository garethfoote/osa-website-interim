<p>Members of the Open Systems Association have contributed texts to the <a href="http://www.transmediale.de/content/evil-media-distribution-centre" title="Evil Media Distribution Centre">Evil Media Distribution Centre</a>, now on display at the 2013 <a href="http://www.transmediale.de/" title="Transmediale">Transmediale festival</a> in Berlin. The installation is an artistic response by <a href="http://yoha.co.uk/" title="YoHa">YoHa</a> to the recently published book Evil Media (2012) by Matthew Fuller and Andrew Goffey, which focusses on the pervasive presence of so-called “gray media” - an expanded notion of media or forms of mediation that provides a deeper, more complex understanding of their
effects on how we act, perceive and think in our daily lives. The artists have invited 66 contributors to choose and write a short text about a gray media object (ranging from tampons to software compilers), and these texts and objects are then presented in the setting of a curiosity cabinet designed as a distribution center.</p>
